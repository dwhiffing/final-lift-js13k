camera shake effect would be nice (just translate context randomly over a set duration?)
need animation of moving between floors (might just be audio based?)

need to randomize buttons on each floor

loop:
timer starts at 99
door opens, camera zooms in on door
PUZZLE MODE
timer counts down while door is open
